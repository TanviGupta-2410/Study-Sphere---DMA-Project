Study Sphere is an interactive platform designed to help students improve their study habits, track progress, and visualize their learning patterns. By combining data analysis, visualization, and insights, the platform provides students with actionable feedback to enhance productivity and confidence.

**Problem Statement**

In today’s academic environment, students are exposed to a wide variety of study patterns, schedules, and motivational factors. However, the connection between these factors and their influence on effective studying is not always clearly understood. Each student develops a unique learning style that depends on multiple elements — such as gender, branch of study, daily study duration, preferred study time, and motivational drivers. These variations can significantly affect concentration, productivity, and exam performance.

The “Study Sphere” project was undertaken to analyze these patterns scientifically using data-driven methods. The goal is to uncover hidden insights regarding how students of different academic backgrounds manage their study time, what motivates them, and what obstacles they face. By visualizing this information, the study aims to present a clearer picture of how study behavior varies among college students and how it can be improved.

**Objectives**

The primary objective of the Study Sphere project is to understand and interpret the underlying behavioral patterns that define the study habits of students at Dr. B. R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar. Beyond that, the study also aims to create meaningful relationships between multiple qualitative and quantitative parameters.

The specific objectives include:

-To explore variations in study habits among students belonging to different branches, genders, and home states.
-To determine the most common study durations and understand how these durations correlate with factors like motivation and confidence.
-To identify students’ preferred times of study (morning, afternoon, evening, or night) and their implications on performance.
-To examine motivational factors such as grades, career goals, or parental expectations that drive students to study.
-To analyse major challenges students face while studying — including procrastination, distractions, or time management issues.
-To visualize relationships and patterns among multiple factors using advanced R-based visualization techniques.
-To generate practical insights that can assist in improving academic performance and mental well-being of students.

By meeting these objectives, the project contributes toward the development of data-informed recommendations for better study strategies and campus-level academic planning.
